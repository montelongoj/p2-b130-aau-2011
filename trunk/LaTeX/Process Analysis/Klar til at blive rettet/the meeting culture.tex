\section{The Meeting Culture}
we made a choice that normally we meet at 09:10 at weekdays if there was no lecture at 08:15 to 12:00. and then we work to 16:15, but we have the choice to leave after 14:00 and then use the time that was left to work at home. But approximately half way through the project there was determined to stay and work to 16:15 because we where getting behind in the project schedule that was made and there was a tendency that there was made less at home.

The meeting culture in the group was work very well, because all in the group where working well together and want to get the best out of this project with the project although we where getting behind with the project schedule nobody had any against the change in the meeting culture. Before starting working on the project there is meeting where we tell what we have work on the previous day and what they are working on. On Friday there is a more in-depth meeting where we look at the status of the project and how the group work together and so on.
